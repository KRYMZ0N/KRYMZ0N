## KRYMZ0N
Hello, I'm KRYMZ0N. I mainly do Minecraft stuff such as plugins and Mods, however I have experience with random other things as well.
## Languages
I am pretty good with Java, and I am alright with Javascript and Python. 

I would like to get better at HTML, CSS.

I would also like to learn C, C#, and C++

## Projects
My main project right now is SimpleExploit fixer, It seeks to patch many exploits mainly lag inducing ones! If you would like to report an exploit, you can make a pull request, or you can contact me in one of the methods below. 

Another project that I have been working on is a 1.16 Fabric Utility Mod called VyperHax!
