## KRYMZ0N
Hello, I'm KRYMZ0N. Ever since I was young I have always been fascinated by computer sciences, but I never thought I'd ever get into it. Around about a year ago, I was put into a computer programming class where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ever since then, I have been learning more and more languages and working on projects during most of my free time!

## Languages
Some languages I know include Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and NodeJS! I plan on getting into C, C++, C#, and possibly Go!

## Projects
Some projects I have been working on include various spigot plugins for my Minecraft Server 16b16t.net, and a couple forge mods/ Hacked clients for Anarchy Servers. Xenophyre is one of those projects that I have been working on recently. Xenophyre is a Minecraft Utility mod for 1.12.2 that is designed for Anarchy servers such as 2b2t!
